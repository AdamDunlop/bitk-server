I have like, the thing, I believe the good thing, that's the thing I believe and than there is this thing. And I don't believe it, but it is there. It's always this thing and then this thing. It's become a category in my brain that I call “of course but maybe.I'll give you an example, okay? Like of course, of course, children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe. Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you're supposed to die. Of course not, of course not, of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I'd be devastated if something happened to him. But maybe, maybe if we all just do this for one year, we're done with nut allergies for ever. No, of course not, of course, if you're fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it's a terrible tragedy, of course, of course, but maybe, may be if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it's not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude, you were just shooting at, it's a tiny bit your fault. " }
